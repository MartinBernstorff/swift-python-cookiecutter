            If you want to fix this, we recommend doing it locally by:
              1. Installing pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install --install-hooks -t pre-push`
              2. Diagnosing the errors by running `pre-commit run --hook-stage push --all-files` 

            After installing pre-commit hooks, they will run automatically in the future when you run `git push`.
